Check-Point Challenge #1

This is a closed book, and no internet checkpoint exam. Please complete this test using Vim.

Do your best to answer each question below. Take as much time as you need. 

————————————————————————


* What does “CLI” stand for
Command Line Interface

* What decimal number does this binary number represent? 010101010
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256       
128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 170

* What is EC2?
Elastic Cloud Computing 

* What is “the cloud”?
Shared resources that are not located on your computer, or localy in your office.


* What is Git?
A version control system and a collaboration tool.


* What is the general workflow of Git?
git clone <url>
or 
git init
git remote add <url>
git add
git commit -m "comment"
git pull
git push


* How do you create a new branch and check it out in one command?
git checkout -b <name of new branch>  


* How do you view the manual for Git?
man git 


* How do you view the manual for a specific Git command?
git help <verb>


* How do you initialize an empty Git repository on your computer?
git init


* How do you clone a Git repository from a remote repository?
git clone <url>


* How do you add a second remote repository to your local Git repo?
git add remote <name> <url>


* How do you push from your local machine to your second remote repo?
git push <name> <branch>


* How do you view the history of all published Git commits in your terminal?
git log


* What does “JVM” stand for?
java virtual machine


* What are the three primary tenets of OOP? Briefly explain each.
Encapsulation: all data and methods that act on that data are encapsulating in a class/object - access modifiers play a big role as , ie private variables

Polymorphism: The ability of one class (or method) to take may forms - for instance the everal times overloaded println() method - which allows us to pass any data type to a single (overridden/overloaded) method

Inheritance: One class can extend another (parent) class and inherit all it's public and protected traits. For instance, Class Apple extends Fruit{} Class Fruit extends Food.


* How do you format the main() method signature?
public static void main(String[] args)


* Name as many Java data types as you can:
int
double
float
byte
short
long
boolian
char
String
Array
Any object

* What is the value of “y” at the end of the following commands? 
        int i = 4;
        int x = 10;
        int y = x/i;

y = 2

* Write a basic “if” statement:
if (condition){
	// do something
}

                
* Write a basic “for” loop:
for (x = 0; x < 10; x++)


* Write a basic “while” loop:
while (condition){
	//do something
}

        
* What does the “&&” operator do?
stops the rest of the problem from iterating if the first part is not true


* How does the “&&” operator differ from the “||” operator?
for the && operator the first one needs to be true to test the second one
for || the first verable needs to be false to test the second one


* Explain what variable “scope” means and how it is determined in Java:
Variable scope is the lifetime and visability of a variable. Variables declared in nested code blocks cannot be used once that code block has been left.


* What does nested scope mean? Write a small example below.
class ScopeExample{
	int var1;

	public int method1(String s){

		int var2;

		for (int i =0; i < 10; i++){
			int var3 = x;
		}
	}
	// var3 is not accessable here
}

* What is the “lifetime” of a variable?
A variable is only accessable while within the scope.



* What data type does ‘c’ represent?
Char



* What does boolean mean?
True or False



* What is going on here? int z = (int) x;
x is being casted



* What does the keyword “break” do?
escapes the nearest  loop



* What does the keyword “continue” do?
forces the next iteration of the loop to take place skipping any remaining code



* What does the keyword “return” do? 
exits a method and returns a value on no value to the caller



* Write two very basic methods (include method declaration/signatures) that demonstrate the two ways you can use the “return” keyword.
int a;
int b;
double x;
double y;

public static int multiply(int a, int b){
return a * b;
}
public static double divide(double x, double y){
return x / y;
}
 

* Write a simple main() method that uses a loop to print out every even number between 0 and 200 in reverse order:
public static void main(String [] args){
int i;

    for (i = 200; i >= 0; i--)
        if (i % 2 == 0){
        
        }    
	sout(i);
}




Congrats! You’re all done! Let’s have some beers! :)
